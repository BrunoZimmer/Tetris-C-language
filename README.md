# :video_game: Tetris in C Language

This is my first pro programming project.

Tetris game developed in a university course, algorithms and programming.

It has a scoreboard with the best scores with the data stores in a document that's saved in the root of the program.

And this tetris have few different types of games, these ones like:
- Exploding pieces:
    When a piece touch the 'ground' all pieces touching this one will disappear.
- Sorting pieces:
    When you try to rotate a piece it will change the type of piece.
